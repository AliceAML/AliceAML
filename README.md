### Bonjour! ðŸ‘‹



I'm a first-year **[Natural Language Procesing MSc](http://www.linguist.univ-paris-diderot.fr/cursusli)** student at the :school: UniversitÃ© de Paris, but that's not all! I've also been **teaching** Intro to :computer: Computer Science classes to high school students for several years, and used to teach English as a certified (***agrÃ©gÃ©e***) teacher. I studied English Language, Literature and History at the **ENS Cachan**, and started learning about NLP in 2014 during an internship.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m thrilled to currently be learning about **Machine Learning** and its applications in **Natural Language Processing**. Check out my progress in my [project board](https://github.com/users/AliceAML/projects/1)
- :snake: I love coding in **Python**, and always strive to make my code more beautiful and Pythonic 
- :open_book: I've started [translating to French](https://github.com/AliceAML/trad-au-dela-fondamentaux-python) the book [*Beyond the basic stuff with Python*](https://inventwithpython.com/beyond/)
- :coffee: I'm also proficient in **Java**!
- :blush: The project I'm proudest of thus far is a [Flask app that generates silly messages from WhatsApp conversation](https://github.com/AliceAML/whatsai) using a Markov chain model! I made it to entertain my friends, and ended up learning a lot.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an NLP project to [automate French inclusive writing](https://github.com/AliceAML/projetEI) (from January to June 2021)
