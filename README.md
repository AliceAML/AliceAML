### Bonjour! ðŸ‘‹



I'm a first-year **NLP MSc** student at the :school: UniversitÃ© de Paris, but that's not all! I've also been **teaching** Intro to :computer: Computer Science classes to high school students for several years, and used to teach English as a certified (***agrÃ©gÃ©e***) teacher. I studied English Language, Literature and History at the **ENS Cachan**, and started learning about NLP in 2014 during an internship.
